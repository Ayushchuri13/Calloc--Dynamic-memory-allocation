# Calloc--Dynamic-memory-allocation
C calloc() method
“calloc” or “contiguous allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type. it is very much similar to malloc() but has two different points and these are:
1.It initializes each block with a default value ‘0’.
2.It has two parameters or arguments as compare to malloc().

Syntax: ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);
